# Implementing-KNN-and-Naives-Bayes-Classifier

This week's project requires us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier. Once we conduct the experiments, we will calculate the resulting metrics:

# a) Specifying the Question
The research problem is to implement Naive Bayes classifier. And futher calculate the resulting metrics

# b) Defining the Metric for Success
This project will be successful when:

1))The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy


# c) Recording the Experimental Design
The following steps were taken:

Business Understanding

Reading the data

Checking our data

Data cleaning

Performing EDA

Naive Bayes Classifier

Challenging the solution

Conclusion

e) Data Relevance
